To run on a pool with machines that may or may not have the right python version or 
modules, you have to pack up your python environment and take it with you.

Here, we accomplish that by using CHTC's job wrapper.  Read about this at:
	chtc.cs.wisc.edu

The job wrapper writes many log files.  The script

    chtcUtils/cleanupCHTCverbosity.pl

will move those files to a chtcOutput/ subdirectory and move the python stdout files to the outdir/ subdirectory.
